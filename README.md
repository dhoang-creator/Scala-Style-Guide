# dhoang-creator Scala Guide

Whilst studying at Codam Coding College, we were not only assessed on whether the applications we created behaved as the project specification laid out but also whether it adhered to a strict style guide. The aim of college's style guide was to ensure that we got into the habit of writing clearly readable and formatted so it would be easier to understand. 

Having read multiple engineer's code over the past few years, this is something that everyone can work on since there are still software engineers who follow style guide anti-patterns and accidentally make it harder for both their colleagues and managers to read and understand their code. 

Scala is a powerfully dynamic paradigmed language which can be expressed both functionally and through object oriented design and because of this, laying out a guide you adhere to throughout your career would ensure that there would be consistency within your work. This does not mean to say that once a style guide is written that it should always be adhered to without any alterations. Similar to ideas & perspectives, a style guide can change and evolve over time, it is simply that you as an individual contributor have an anchor to look back at and keep your code grounded.
